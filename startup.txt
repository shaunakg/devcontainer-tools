There are scripts available that can make your experience
with the container more streamlined. They are situated in
the following directory: `/home/coder/tools`

To setup a tunnel:
  1. Run `sh /home/coder/tools/tunnel.sh`
  2. Authorize with Cloudflare
  3. From then on, use `mktun <port> <domain>`
  4. <port> is forwarded to `devtunnel--<domain>.srg.id.au`

This instance has been provisioned with access to the
srg internal network. Monitoring is forwarded to the
global logging Elasticsearch cluster. To see the status,
go to http://k.odin.srg.id.au/app/metrics/inventory.
